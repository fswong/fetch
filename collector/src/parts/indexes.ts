            e.g. bibles/eng_bsb/html/1ch.html -> Regenerating bibles/eng_bsb/html/
        If a file has been removed, may need to remove its parent index
            But should readDir the parent to see if other files still exist, and regenerate it if so
        Dir paths should always end in a slash and shoudn't include 'index.html'
