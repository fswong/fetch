h1 The need for more access to the Bible
h3.warn Only 81% of the world has a complete bible in their language
p It is well known that there are still many languages without a bible translation. However, what is lesser known is how many languages lack a translation that is legal to freely share.
p Many Christian organizations are working towards the whole world having access to the Bible in their own language. However, what do we really mean by "access"? At the moment, access usually means you can read a translation in a select few apps, buy it in a store, and quote a few verses.
p But there are many things you #[strong can't] do with such bibles (without special permission) due to copyright, such as print portions of them yourself, include them in ministry resources, distribute audio recordings of them, etc.
p The following statistics are about bibles that are both #[strong complete] and #[strong modern] (published in last {{ modern_years }} years).

h2 Shareable bible translations
p A truely shareable bible translation is one that can be copied and quoted without verse limits.
h3.warn Only {{ world_shareable_percent }}% of the world has a translation they can legally share themselves

h2 Unrestricted bible translations
p Having true "access" to a translation should mean you can use it however you need to, including improving it. We define "unrestricted" as being either public domain or requiring only attribution (sharealike licenses also count).
h3.warn Only {{ world_unrestricted_percent }}% of the world has a bible they have unrestricted access to
//- NOTE Haven't included a table for this as overlaps too much with above and can be confusing

h2 Audio bibles
p The situation is unfortunately even worse when it comes to audio, noting that many people in the world cannot read (or prefer not to).
p
    strong Data coming soon...
//- h3.warn Only X% of the world has a shareable audio bible in their language
//- h3.warn Only X% of the world has an unrestricted audio bible in their language
