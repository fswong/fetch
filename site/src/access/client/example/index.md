# Example app

To show how easy fetch(bible) is to use, here's a basic bible app created with a single file of plain HTML/CSS/JS. For a more complex example with a nicer UI you can also check out [the web app](/access/app/) and [its source code](https://github.com/gracious-tech/fetch/tree/master/app).
