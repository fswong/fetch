# fetch(bible) is...

 * __A collection__ of all available Bible translations
 * __A service__ for free access to the collection
 * __A tool__ for integrating the Bible into apps and websites

Together, it's a digital bible platform that lets anyone access scripture in thousands of translations, whether to display a single verse or power an entire bible app.

## What makes fetch(bible) special?

 * __It's easy to use__ &mdash; Whether you want a UI, API, or manual access
 * __It's efficient__ &mdash; All content is compressed and distributed via a CDN
 * __It's open source__ &mdash; Anyone can contribute, fork, self-host
 * __It's private__ &mdash; No tracking of users and no registration required
 * __It's unrestricted__ &mdash; No request limits, no cache limits, 100% free

While fetch(bible) has no restrictions itself, most Bible translations have terms you must still comply with, and fetch(bible) makes this easy by filtering translations based on your intended use.

## Who made fetch(bible)?

[Gracious Tech](https://gracious.tech) created and maintains fetch(bible), and we believe _"All Scripture is God-breathed"_ (2 Timothy 3:16) and essential for everyone to have unrestricted access to.

Though our work was only possible thanks to the [extensive efforts of others](/legal/credits/) who have been translating, collecting, and working on tools that fetch(bible) makes use of.
